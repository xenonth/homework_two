# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Feedback
The web design side of web development is not my strongest suite, however I did enjoy the challenge this assignment brought. As you will see my layout and the UI is relatively simple as I am more passionate about programming and backend development then User Interface.  As my skills and understanding increases so to will the layout appear more friendly.

## Approach
I started by planning out how I wanted the navigation bar, footer, and central content to look.  A very simple bootstrap navbar design, with a footer bar at the bottom of the webpage content of a similiar color.  After creating the template code on the index.html file I tehn copy and pasted to the other pages.  The next step was to focus on each webpages' content starting with forms as that appeared to be the most difficult first.  It took several attempts for the card that the form was inside to be a complete grey background.

Next was my background, since I was unsure of what to write I decided to write my resume in text form in a two by two format using the row and clumn system as well as cards.  

Lastly, was the images, I was planning to have two images per row but having a lack of 'portfolio images' I settled on five, two of me at important social events, two from my photography files and one of recieving a degree.  With the image hideyhole and its size I had two put it in row "2" in order to have the design feel more aesthetically pleasing. 

Lastly I spent a few hours changing divs into semantic html, and cleaqning up and modifying code adding in css style sheet links where required to have a professional look.  Last activity was to give the images a figcaption which after testing I believe may have broke the auto resizing on portfolio but due to the size of the images and that they are just a fill in I am currently ok with this.
