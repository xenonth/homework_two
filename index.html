          </h3>
          <p>
            Im in training to be a full stack web developer with the goal to be helping local business's increase their online presence. I have a background in airline operations and have completed various safety and security courses to allow me access to extremely secure areas.
            I currently study Web Development at the University of Adelaide with a focus on front and back end development. I have a strong interest and passion for innovation and problem solving and am able to adapt this to small business strategy.
            I have a wide array of projects which have all reach their intended target and benchmark throughout the local community. My most recent achievement was creating web application for a living narrative experience for Warhammer 40k players.

          <p>
            I have over five years combined frontline aviation experience with a complete understanding of what I need to bring for a efficient team to perform. Additionally I have over five years combined experience problem solving  for community and work projects and events.
